**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** is a powerful JavaScript library used to create high-performance animations on the web. It is widely known for its flexibility, efficiency, and smooth performance, making it a favorite among web developers and animators. GSAP allows developers to animate CSS properties, SVGs, canvas elements, and more with precise control, making it easy to create complex, fluid animations.

### Key Features of GSAP:
1. **Performance**: It is optimized for speed, ensuring smooth animations even on lower-end devices.
2. **Ease of Use**: GSAP simplifies the process of creating animations with intuitive methods like `.to()`, `.from()`, `.timeline()`, etc.
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: GSAP works consistently across different browsers, eliminating the need to worry about browser-specific bugs or limitations.
4. **Flexible Animations**: You can animate any numerical property of a DOM element, including positions, sizes, colors, rotations, and more.
5. **Timelines**: GSAP's timeline feature lets you sequence multiple animations in a coordinated way.
6. **Plugins**: GSAP offers a variety of plugins like ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MorphSVG, and more to extend its capabilities.

### Common Methods:
- `gsap.to(target, {options})`: Animates properties to a certain value.
- `gsap.from(target, {options})`: Animates properties from a value to their current value.
- `gsap.timeline()`: Allows chaining multiple animations in a coordinated sequence.

Because of its versatility, GSAP is used for creating animations in interactive websites, banner ads, & even large-scale applications like video games or presentations.
So, I created a demo project using gsap, below the video given is to showcase the final outcome of the project.
